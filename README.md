# AGM-Openweather-Integration
Enabling openweather map layers (or any other tile service provider) integration with Angular Google Maps

Currently we can not directly integrate Open Weather Maps with AGM maps. So here I'm providing a workaround for that.
The issue was pending from 2016, so here we can get an idea to implement it.

Developed with:
- AGM version: 1.0.0.beta 2
- Angular Version: 6

# Required modifications before running the app:
1. Google API key (will be required to enable AGM maps to work)
2. Open weather API key (currently added free API)

# Steps to run:
1. Pull the repository
2. Do npm start / ng serve
3. Run on any browser with localhost:4200 / or whatever port which the application got.
